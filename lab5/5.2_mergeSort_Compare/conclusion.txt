1. The actual number of comparisons in both average and best cases closely follows the theoretical n log2(n) - n + 1 curve.
2. The best case performs slightly better than the average case, but both follow a similar growth pattern.
3. The algorithm's performance aligns well with its theoretical time complexity, demonstrating that merge sort maintains its efficiency across different input sizes and scenarios.
